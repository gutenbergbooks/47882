The latter is a native of the Atlantic
States and breeds from Maine northward
to Hudson Bay. The former frequents
the interior of the United States and migrates
northward as far as the Great
Slave Lake. It is seldom seen in the Atlantic
States except during its migrations.</p>
<p>In this connection the account of Mr.
William Dutcher, regarding the first observation
of the Palm Warbler in Long
Island, is of interest. It is the more interesting
because it partially answers the
question so often asked, &ldquo;Where do the
birds die?&rdquo; Mr. Dutcher says, &ldquo;During
the night of the twenty-third of September,
1887, a great bird wave was rolling
southward along the Atlantic coast. Mr.
E. J. Udall, of the Fire Island Light,
wrote me that the air was full of birds.
Very many of the little travellers met
with an untimely fate, for Mr. Udall
picked up at the foot of the light house
tower, and shipped to me, no less than
five hundred and ninety-five victims.
Twenty-five species were included in the
number, all of them being land birds,
very nearly half of which were Wood
Warblers. Among them I found one
Palm Warbler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both varieties winter in the Southern
States that border the Atlantic ocean
and the Gulf of Mexico, in Mexico and in
the islands of the West Indies. While
both birds are often seen in the same
flock during the winter, the Palm Warbler
is much more common in Florida
than is the eastern cousin. When together
the two forms may be readily
distinguished by the brighter yellow of
the yellow palm warbler.</p>
<p>Three of the large family of Wood
Warblers may be called the vagabonds of
the family, for they do not love the forest.
These are the Palm, the yellow Palm
and the Prairie Warblers.</p>
<p>Dr. Ridgway says of the Palm Warbler,
&ldquo;During the spring migration
this is one of the most abundant of the
warblers,&rdquo; in Illinois, &ldquo;and for a brief
season may be seen along the fences, or
the borders of fields, usually near the
ground, walking in a graceful, gliding
manner, the body tilting and the tail oscillating
at each step. For this reason it
is sometimes, and not inappropriately
called Wag-Tail Warbler.&rdquo; The observer
is reminded of the titlarks as he
watches the nervous activity of this Warbler
as it constantly jerks its tail while
it flutters about the hedges and scattered
shrubbery, or when running on the
ground among the weeds of old fields.
It may even frequent dusty roadsides.
Wherever it is, it frequently utters its
low &ldquo;tsip,&rdquo; a note that is very similar to
that of many of its sister warblers.</p>
<p>Dr. Brewer says, &ldquo;They have no other
song than a few simple and feeble notes,
so thin and weak that they might almost
be mistaken for the sound made by the
common grasshopper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Palm Warbler&rsquo;s nest is a trim
structure, usually placed upon the
ground and never far above it. The
walls consist of interwoven dry grasses,
stems of the smaller herbaceous plants,
bark fibres and various mosses. It is
lined with very fine grasses, vegetable
down and feathers. Though this home
is placed in quite open places, a retired
spot is usually selected. Here are laid
the white or buffy white eggs, more or
less distinctly marked with a brownish
color, and a family of four or five of these
peculiar Warblers is raised.</p>

<h2 id="c3">OLD-FASHIONED OUTINGS.
<br /><span class="small">PART II.</span></h2>
<p>While in our camp on the shore of
Gloucester harbor, many were our adventures
first and last, some of our own
choosing, some not. In the mouth of
Rafe&rsquo;s Chasm is a big oblong seamed
rock, considerably lower than either wall
at that point, with perpendicular sides
and top slanting to the lower wall, which
is the west, and the natural approach.
At low tide the boys made a point of
leaping the western channel and climbing
up across the narrower eastern one,
and where the boys went, the younger
girls expected to follow. (How was it,
I wonder, that girls began to be &ldquo;tomboys&rdquo;
just then? They have kept it up
ever since, but it is no longer a matter
of reproach.) The first girl who did
this held the championship for some
time, but the smaller ones qualified in
the end. We were there one day at half
tide when a good deal of surf was running,
so we established ourselves well
up on the rocks, but our Newfoundland
dog elected to go down and enter the
water at the western corner of the
chasm. He was immediately swept out,
and out started somebody&rsquo;s eyes!
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost your dog!&rdquo; But even as
we gazed in consternation, the wave&mdash;walked
back and returned him! A
strange sight it was&mdash;that black dog
advancing as in a vehicle, standing unconcernedly
in a tall green wave and,
when it arrived, walking calmly out and
shaking himself! No suction, no
struggle, his feet just on a level with the
flat ledge; out he walked and was
hugged, dripping, as soon as we could
lay hold of him.</p>
<p>The Magnolia Swamp stretches far
toward Essex and Manchester, and with
the surrounding heath and forest forms
a wilderness which a wild animal might
range for miles, crossing now and then
a lonely road; and in the summer of
1884 two of us saw a very odd wild animal
in the old road. Descending suddenly
from the hill above, we saw a
dingy white creature jogging slowly
along in the middle of the road a short
stone&rsquo;s throw ahead. It was clumsily
made, and its gait was awkward and
lumbering. It had short legs, very round
hind-quarters, no perceptible tail, and
long, slightly wavy white hair, exactly
the same all over, without mark, spot or
difference. We mended our pace and
gained on it, when the creature did the
same without looking round and
plunged into a dense cover of brier with
the heavy rolling gait of an elephant
and at such an angle that we never saw
its head, nor could we trace its line of
retreat in the underbrush.</p>
<p>Now what was that? Please don&rsquo;t
say poodle or woodchuck or skunk or
raccoon. It bore no resemblance to
either, except, in size and color, to the
poodle. The only thing I ever saw at
all like it was a stuffed lynx in a New
Hampshire town. In color, length of
hair, and absence of tail they were exactly
alike. The stuffed specimen was
twice as big as the live animal and long-limbed
in proportion, while the latter
was thick-set and clumsy like a cub.</p>
<p>One September day at sunset I was
sitting on a low rock platform trying to
paint a great green wave which reappeared
at regular intervals, gathering
under the rock with a growl and falling
on the shore like lead. (The effort
looked like a tin wave, and an artist said
it should not have been attempted. The
opposite headland was better, fresh
from one ducking and expecting another
from the pale green border surging up
out of the gray, away from the eye.) At
last the sole companionship of this sulky
wave became oppressive, and turning
landward, I looked up into an uncanny
sky&mdash;a wild red afterglow barring the
slate with flame-color&mdash;and smelt a
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
skunk, and felt far from home. And
there on the top of the ridge, the highest
point in that great amphitheater of
wooded hills, the only habitation in
sight, it stood out black against those
flaming bars, amid the silhouettes of
dying pines.</p>
<p>The dog would have been a support,
but he wasn&rsquo;t there. After some experience
of sketching-parties, he had given
up attending. Collies are particular,
and this one hated to sit with the wind
in his face. When we first had him, he
dogged every footstep for fear of being
left behind, but at this stage of his development
he would not stir a step with
sketching material or a gardening hat;
he knew too well that such accessories
led to nothing. Yet his polished behavior
in other respects had so impressed a
small visitor in long Greenaway robe
and cap, that when she made her series
of curtsies to the family semicircle on
leaving, she curtsied with equal gravity
to the dog as he lay chin to the floor,
half under the table. And that was
quite right. Doubtless we all bow to
persons far less deserving than this forgiving
dog who always hastened to console
you when you trod on him.</p>
<p>However, on this occasion I had to
get home alone and dodge skunks unsupported
under that awesome sky. The
best part of a mile away and all the way
up-hill, the last pitch abominably steep
and rough, the choice of site would have
done credit to a robber baron, but the
land falls away gently to the Manchester
road on the other side. It took months
with a derrick and oxen to forge the connecting
link, however; and one section,
which rounds a hill and crosses a gully,
looked like the bed of a mountain torrent
for weeks. The camp of 1865 led
to the choice of 1883, as many a camp
has done from Roman days on. The
Pequot war settled central Massachusetts
as the Revolution filled up New
Hampshire and Vermont. It was not so
much that the land stood empty as that
men went out and saw the land, that it
was good. Behold a by-product of war.</p>
<p>If the merry greenwood was as our
native heath, so too was the water. It
was about a third of a mile off the Rock
that he of the rifle once had a difference
with a shark. He was out alone in a
dory when the shark happened along and
thought, being there, he might as well
see if he couldn&rsquo;t upset the boat. So
he came swarming up on the oar until
the youth got tired of it, and standing
up, balanced himself not to overreach in
case the shark proved slippery and
thrust the butt as hard as he dared between
the eyes, which were about a
foot apart. But the shark was not slippery.
He felt rough, and as hard and
solid as a ledge, while the youth felt as
if he had hit that same. However, his
Honor seems not to have enjoyed it
either, for he soon settled in the water,
and circling lower and lower two or
three times, disappeared.</p>
<p>Some years before that, this boy was
out with another when the harbor was
full of herring, and a whale appeared
which had followed the schools in. And
he popped up so frequently and blew in
such unexpected places that the boys
deemed it best to make for the nearest
land. Meantime the whale rose in their
wake with his jaws wide open in the
middle of a school of herring, and they
saw a lot of the fish flipping dry in his
throat; and the boat came in and all the
passengers stood on deck looking at
him, and then he got excited and ran
aground, the tide being low, on some
shoals in behind the Island, and
thrashed about so, they thought he must
have hurt himself. It was a thrilling
afternoon.</p>
<p>The dory is a proved little craft for
serious business in rough water, while
none can be better for ladies about rocks
and beaches; because it has a flat bottom
and there is no keel to catch and leave
you tipping about with the lap of the
water running ever so far inside.
Moreover, the dory has so much shear
that very little of the bottom touches at
one time; and if it hangs anywhere, you
can take it by the nose and work it off
quite easily. We fully appreciated the
merits of a build which permitted crossing
the harbor in good gowns to make a
call we did not wish to spend a whole
evening on, landing perhaps on a lonely
bit of shingle with a sharp little sea
thrashing in, &ldquo;firing&rdquo; all along the tops
of the waves. We often went out to
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
supper in dories, taking a small charcoal
furnace, a griddle and a pitcher of
batter, and rowing down to some great
flat sheets of rock made for the purpose
on the Point. There we pulled up the
boats, set up housekeeping and fried our
flapjacks, first waiting to enjoy the sunset
over the western shore reflected in
the harbor. (If you stay in the house
the sun always sets while you are at
supper, if you notice; and this is nature&rsquo;s
revenge on you for eating indoors instead
of out-of-doors, like Christians.)
Then we rowed home by moonlight or
perhaps by starlight, pausing to amuse
ourselves by stamping on the bottom of
the boat, startling the fish under us and
making them dart, leaving a phosphorescent
wake far below.</p>
<p>If a thunder-shower surprised us, we
rolled the boats over and crept under,
the valued shear allowed plenty of air.
It is true, if the shower lasted too long,
the water was apt to run down the rock
and leave somebody in a puddle, while it
might become painful to take too perfect
an impression of the pattern of the
rock on one elbow, but it&rsquo;s worth getting
wet to cross the harbor in the rain
with the drops hissing in the water and
turning to pale fire wherever they strike.</p>
<p>The dory is a stiff little craft, too, not
easily upset, as some of our party proved
at the beach one day. Half-a-dozen of
them embarked in bathing dresses and
when beyond their depth stood up on the
seats and rocked with all their might;
but this not effecting their purpose, the
girls jumped out and the two or three
men left danced on the gunwale and
finally overturned it.</p>
<p>One starlight evening two of us, escaping
from the heat in town, were floating
close inshore somewhere down near
Black Bess, when suddenly out of the
darkness arose the sound of a sailboat
bearing down on us full tilt. We sprang
up in dismay, though it was dead calm
and we knew no boat could come where
we were. We peered into the darkness,
but nothing came and the sound died
as it sprung into being, full grown,
without crescendo and without diminuendo.
There was no splashing, either;
just the full, steady rip of the cutwater
at speed. It lasted perhaps a minute,
and was a startling affair. Experienced
persons say they never heard anything
like it, and suggest sharks. People always
suggest that&mdash;what can you expect
after Lyell said shark to our family pet,
&ldquo;the sea-serpent,&rdquo; which our own grandparents
saw in 1817 from such a coign
of vantage that if it had been a shark,
one would think they would have known
it. We all know the place where they
were driving &ldquo;along the edge of a cliff&mdash;when
he saw the sea-serpent at the base&mdash;on
the white beach where there was
not more than six or seven feet of
water; and giving the reins to his wife,
looked down upon the creature, and
made up his mind that it was ninety
feet long. He then took his wife to the
spot, and she said it was as long as their
wharf, and this measured one hundred
feet. While they were looking down on
it, the creature appeared to be alarmed,
and started off.&rdquo; (Lyell&rsquo;s Diary.) This
is an incredulous world.</p>
<p>Does anyone ever read &ldquo;The Toilers
of the Sea&rdquo; nowadays, or remember the
finale? Having purposely allowed the
tide to catch him, the hero sits in a niche
in the cliff awaiting death, with his eye
on the ship which bears away his beloved,
who has married the wrong man.
And as the ship drops behind the horizon,
the water covers his eyes&mdash;when we
read that, with one accord we made for
the beach, and as soon as the tide served
round a big ledge, we practiced that
scene, and found it unimpressive. As
we expected, you float off: you can&rsquo;t stay
there! and we thought Victor Hugo
should really have practiced it himself.</p>

<p>The Long-billed Curlew is the largest
of the American curlews and has a wide
range covering nearly the whole of temperate
North America. It is not a bird
of high altitudes and in winter it seeks
the milder climate of the Southern
States, Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba and
Jamaica. During the breeding season,
which is passed in the South Atlantic
States or in the interior of North America
as far north as Manitoba, it is not a
social bird. While migrating, however,
and in winter, it enjoys the society of its
fellows and is generally observed in flocks
of a greater or less number.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson has well described its
flight during migration or when passing
from one feeding ground to another. He
says, &ldquo;The Curlews fly high, generally in
a wedge-like form, somewhat resembling
certain ducks, occasionally uttering their
loud, whistling note, by a dexterous imitation
of which a whole flock may sometimes
be enticed within gunshot, while
the cries of the wounded are sure to detain
them until the gunner has made repeated
shots and great havoc among
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the natural home of the curlews
is the muddy shores and grassy lowlands
adjacent to bodies of water the
Long-billed species also frequents drier
places at a distance from water, and even
breeds in the uplands. Here their food
consists of worms, insects and berries.
When fattened with such food their flesh
is tender and lacks the stronger flavor
that is present when they have fed exclusively
on the animal food of the
marshes of the sea shore. It is interesting
to watch the Curlew upon the beach
as it gracefully moves from point to
point in search of food. Now and then
it thrusts its long sensitive bill into the
soft soil and usually draws forth some
form of animal food&mdash;a larva of some
insect, a crab, a snail or a worm. Frequently
it will explore the holes of crawfish
and it is often rewarded with a
dainty morsel of curlew food.</p>
<p>The Curlew&rsquo;s bill is very characteristic
and especially adapted to the bird&rsquo;s habit
of probing for food. It is very variable
in length and not infrequently grows to
a length of seven or eight inches, and
it has been known to reach a length of
nearly nine inches. The upper mandible is
somewhat longer than the under and is
provided with a knob at the tip. The bill
is much curved, a characteristic which
has given the bird the names Sickle-bill
and Sickle-billed Curlew or Snipe. It
was the curved bill that suggested to Linnaeus
the generic name Numenius for
the curlews. It is a Greek word meaning
the new moon. The long bill also
suggested to Wilson the specific name
longirostris or long-snouted.</p>
<p>Dr. Coues says, &ldquo;Its voice is sonorous
and not at all musical. During the breeding
season, in particular, its harsh cries
of alarm resound when the safety of its
nest or young is threatened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Long-billed Curlew spends but
little time in home building. Its nest
consists of a layer of grass placed in any
suitable saucer shaped hollow on the
ground.</p>
<p>The downy young resemble the adult
bird but little. In color they are a pale
brownish yellow modified by a trace of sulphur
yellow, the under parts being somewhat
darker. The upper parts are irregularly
mottled with coarse black spots.
At this period in the life of this Curlew,
the bill is straight and about one and
one-half inches in length.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c6">ON JEWELLED WINGS.</h2>
<p>There are few or none who fail to
delight in the beauty of the butterfly,
while to the thinker its different stages
of existence are rich with lessons in
which the analogy-loving soul of man
can revel to fullest gratification. Flitting
about above the things of earth it
seems to descend for rest only, or to sip
the sweets of some nectar-bearing flower.
In the sunshine all day long, chasing
at will through field or woodland, and
with no more care than the so-called
&ldquo;butterflies of fashion&rdquo; (not as much,
for it needs to give no thought to the
fashion or fit of its garb), it basks till
nightfall in the delights that go to make
up its ethereal existence.</p>
<p>But whenever we thus watch the brilliant
little creature we should remember
that it has come up through many
changes and tribulations to this its last
and perfect stage. Weeks, months, or&mdash;as
in the case of one or two species&mdash;three
years before, a tiny egg was deposited
in some safe, secluded spot, the
parent butterflies dying soon after because
of their mission being then accomplished.</p>
<p>The egg is the first stage of the butterfly,
as it is also of the moth. The
eggs of the different species vary greatly
in size and shape, and are deposited
in as many different kinds of places.
Some are placed on the under side of
leaves, others on the outside of the
cocoon; some are glued together in rings
around the smaller branches of fruit
trees, others on the interior of bee-hives.
In this stage they remain for
periods varying from a few weeks to
three years, when the larva or caterpillar
state is entered upon. The larv&aelig; are
very greedy, beginning to eat as soon
as hatched and devouring the leaves,
spreading themselves over the web prepared
for them by the parent, ravaging
the fruit trees, or routing the bees from
their rightful possessions. A number of
changes of skin take place during the
larval stage, ranging from five to ten.
Some are smooth-skinned and are used
by insectivorous animals for food, while
others are hairy and on this account are
rejected as food, the hair having the
power of stinging much the same as
nettles.</p>
<p>Having attained its full growth the
instincts of the caterpillar undergo a
change. It ceases to eat and begins to
weave a couch or cocoon round about
itself by which it is finally more or less
enclosed. It then throws off the caterpillar
or larval skin and appears in the
third stage.</p>
<p>This state of its existence seems to
me the most mysterious and therefore
the most interesting. More than one of
these cocoons have I found attached to
walls, fences, limbs and in similar
places, looking as though they were but
the dried-up remains of some species of
insect life. But there was life within
them, a germ which sooner or later
would spring forth in all the wonderful
beauty of the moth or the butterfly.</p>
<p>This third period is termed the pupa,
nymph or chrysalis state. Its duration
varies from a few weeks to several
months, according to the time of year
at which it enters this stage. The common
Cabbage Butterfly, which rears
two broods during the season, is quickest
to make the change, only a few weeks
of the pupa form being necessary. Some
remain in the chrysalis a month or more,
appearing in the butterfly form at the
close of the summer. Those becoming
encased in autumn are like the hibernating
animals in many respects, lying dormant
the winter through. The only
sign of life ever discovered in the pupa
is a convulsive twitching when irritated,
and for this reason those who know
nothing of the hidden beauties of butterfly
life miss a great deal of pleasure in
not being able to study the seemingly lifeless
chrysalis.</p>
<p>When mature the pupa case cracks
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
toward the anterior end, and the butterfly
or moth crawls forth with wings
which, though at first small and crumpled
up, in a few hours attain their full
size. As soon as they are strong enough
the new creature mounts upon them and,
if it be a butterfly, flies out into the sunlight;
while the moth hies away to some
dark corner until nightfall, then for the
first time in its existence it rises upon
wings to enjoy the summer zephyrs.</p>
<p>I remember having watched one butterfly
leave the chrysalis and, though
but a child at the time, I shall never outlive
the impressions which that rare
pleasure left with me. It was one of
the large-winged, black-white-and-yellow
fellows which every one admires so
much, and which species is regarded as
a treasure here in these Central States.
Little by little the ugly casing opened,
and when I first saw the baby butterfly
he was like a tiny mass of mingled colors,
with neither life nor shape to give
me an idea of the sort of creature into
which he would develop. Soon he began
to move uneasily, like a child awaking
out of a long sleep; then he stretched
his wings leisurely as though proud to
have found them at last. Next he drew
himself up and finished bursting his
paper-like shell, gained a foothold on the
plank on which we had placed him and
looked about with a, seemingly, very
much surprised though gratified air.
Meanwhile he kept working his wings
and stretching them anon, very impatient
because of their, to him, slow growth.
At last he gained the confidence to try
them, and within an hour from the time
we first saw him he had arisen and flown
away into the sunshine to seek his place
in the world.</p>
<p>Butterflies and moths are widely distributed
all over the globe, occurring,
however, in greatest variety and abundance
in tropical lands. They are found
as far north as Spitzbergen, on the Alps
to the height of 9,000 feet, and to double
that height on the Andes. In Great
Britain there are sixty-six species, while
in all Europe only three hundred and
ninety have been enumerated. In Brazil
there are about seven hundred, and the
total number of species of moths is about
two thousand. Among the butterflies
are to be found some exceedingly beautiful
insects, some of them very large,
especially in the tropical belt.</p>
<p>The butterflies are to insects what the
humming-birds are to the feathered
tribes, the analogy holding good not
only in the brilliant colors and manner
of flight, but also in the nature of their
nutriment&mdash;the honeyed juices of flowers.
Both seem destined to brighten and
beautify the way for man, while the
lesson of immortality gathered from the
life of the ethereal butterfly, like that
conveyed by the beautiful and ever-wandering
Psyche of Greek mythology, is
so easy of comprehension that we can
but stop and wonder at the exquisite

<h2 id="c8">THE EVERGLADE KITE.

<p class="t0">High in mid-air the sailing hawk is pois&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;<span class="sc">Isaac McLellan</span>, &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s Invitation.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Everglade Kite or Snail Hawk, as
it is sometimes called, has a very small
range within the borders of the United
States, where it is limited to the swamps
and marshes of Southern Florida. It also
frequents Eastern Mexico, Central America,
Cuba and the eastern portion of
South America as far southward as the
Argentine Republic.</p>
<p>Its habits are very interesting.
Peaceable and sociable at all times, other
birds do not fear them. &ldquo;The name of
the Sociable Marsh Hawk is very appropriate,
for they invariably live in flocks of
from twenty to a hundred individuals and
migrate and even breed in company. In
Buenos Ayres they appear in September
and resort to marshes and streams
abounding in large water snails, on which
they feed exclusively.&rdquo; They spend
much of the time flying, and when soaring
will frequently remain poised in the
air for a considerable time without apparent
motion, except that the tail is constantly
and nervously moved in nearly
every direction.</p>
<p>An authority, writing of these birds in
Florida, says, &ldquo;Their favorite nesting
sites are swamps overgrown with low
willow bushes, the nests usually being
placed about four feet from the ground.
They frequent the borders of open ponds
and feed their young entirely on snails.
According to my observations the female
does not assist in the building of the nest.
I have watched these birds for hours.
She sits in the immediate vicinity of the
nest and watches while the male builds it.
The male will bring a few twigs and alternate
this work at the same time by
supplying his mate with snails, until the
structure is completed. They feed and
care for their young longer than any other
birds I know of, until you can scarcely
distinguish them from the adults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nest is a flat structure, the cavity
being rarely more than two or three inches
in depth, and the whole structure is
about twelve or sixteen inches in diameter
and about one-half as high. It is
usually placed in low shrubs or fastened
to the rank growth of saw grass sufficiently
low to be secure from observation.
The materials used in its construction are
generally dry twigs and sticks loosely
woven together. The cavity may be bare
or lined with small vines, leaves or dry
saw grass.</p>
<p>Dr. A. K. Fisher says, &ldquo;Its food, as
far as known, consists exclusively of
fresh-water univalve mollusks, which it
finds among the water plants at the
edges of shallow lakes and rivers or the
overflowed portions of the everglades.
When the bird has captured one of these
mollusks it flies to the nearest perch and
removes the meat from the shell with
apparent ease and without injuring the
latter. While collecting food it will often
secure five or six before returning to the
nest, keeping in its gullet the parts it has
extracted for the young.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c9">THE ANIMALS&rsquo; FAIR.
<br /><span class="small">PART I.</span></h2>
<p>Once upon a time&mdash;for this is a fairy
story&mdash;all the beasts and birds and bugs
gathered in a solemn convention. The
object of their meeting was explained by
the dog, who&mdash;because of his intelligence
and his intimacy with men and their
ways&mdash;had been elected chairman of the
convention.</p>
<p>He spoke thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, we have gathered here to
discuss an important question, namely,
&lsquo;Our dealings with men, and men&rsquo;s dealings
with us.&rsquo; It is a sad fact that although
we are the benefactors of mankind,
and positively necessary to their
well-being and even to their lives, they
do not appreciate us as they should. If
you will pardon my egotism, I will illustrate
this assertion by my own experience.
I may say modestly&mdash;for I am
only quoting men&rsquo;s words&mdash;that I am
considered the most intelligent of beasts,
and am chosen as the companion, the
playmate, the assistant, yea, the protector
of man. I cheer hours of his loneliness
from the cradle to the grave, and am
ever ready to assist him in a thousand
different ways. Yet how am I treated?
A hard crust, a dry bone, kicks and
curses and harsh words, a bed on a hard
plank or on the cold ground, wherever
I can find it. These are too often the
inventory of my rewards; while the torments
inflicted by small boys, and the indignity
and torture of tin cans tied to
my tail, fill the full record of my tale of
woe. No doubt the rest of you have
grievances many and various.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be pleased to hear from any
of you who desire to speak, and will be
glad of any suggestion, or plan for the
general good which may present itself to
you. The meeting is now open for remarks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down on his tail and assumed
his most dignified and intelligent expression,
while he looked about the miscellaneous
assembly. In an instant the horse
walked forward, and was duly recognized
by the chairman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words of our chairman have
struck a responsive chord in my heart,&rdquo;
he said gravely. &ldquo;I have pondered on
this subject many times when suffering
from the abuse of men. Sometimes I am
driven at my utmost speed for hours at
a time, while my head is held unnaturally
high and my graceful neck cramped and
stiffened by the cruel check-rain; my
body exposed to the torments of flies because
my beautiful tail has been docked;
and then, when weary and sore and over-heated,
I am tied up in some chilling
draught of wind while my feet are
obliged to stand in a wet gutter, and I
am stiffened and ruined for life by some
person&rsquo;s ignorance or foolishness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem a pity, to me, that some
more rational creature than man had not
been chosen as &lsquo;The lord of creation&rsquo; in
the beginning. Why, he cannot govern
himself. Then how can he be capable of
governing us who follow unerring instincts
with unfailing faithfulness? The
question is wide as the world and deep as
the sea. As I have said, I have pondered
it many times in all its aspects, but
as yet have reached no definite conclusion
which might suggest a remedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, let me urge upon you all
to give us your wisest thoughts upon this
subject, which is of vital importance to
us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to his place and waited
anxiously for the next speaker.</p>
<p>The cat took the floor with a graceful
step and a gentle expression which
caught the favor of the assembly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am small among beasts, but my
grievances are many and great. I am
chosen by men as a playmate for their
children, so that the mothers may be free
to attend to what they call their &lsquo;necessary
work&rsquo; in peace and without interruption.
How am I rewarded?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;The children whom I strive to amuse
drag me ceaselessly around, pull my
tail and pinch my ears, blow in my face
and jerk my sensitive whiskers; and if
I remonstrate with voice or teeth or
claws, I am beaten and kicked and tossed
out of doors without even the privilege
of trial by jury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I catch the rats and mice which infest
men&rsquo;s houses, and then when they
forget to give me milk which is so necessary
to prevent the ill effects which follow
a diet of meat and I help myself
delicately to a few laps of cream, I am
abused as if I had committed a mighty
and unpardonable sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call me a necessity, yet they
drown my beautiful kittens, or carry
them off in bags and cast them helpless
and forlorn upon the mercy of a cold and
cruel world. And then men presume to
say that they are made after the image
of God, and have been divinely appointed
masters of the world! What blasphemy!
What blind stupidity! Words fail me in
view of these appalling facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half the assembly was in tears before
poor pussy had finished her category of
woes.</p>
<p>A fly buzzed forward with impulsive
haste, and spoke with a little rasping
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We flies are small; but we are mighty.
We remove mountains of dirt for uncleanly
men, and how do they reward
us? They catch us in traps and drown
us with boiling water. They snare our
feet with treacherous fly-papers, and
after laughing at our struggles to get
free, burn us without mercy. Small boys
torture us with pins, or pull off legs and
wings for what they call &lsquo;fun.&rsquo; If they
do not want us about them, why do they
make the filth which necessitates our
presence? That is a conundrum beyond
my solving. I leave it for this wise assembly
to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fly buzzed back to a sunny spot,
and an unwieldy hog ambled forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As greedy as a hog.&rsquo; &lsquo;As lazy as a
pig.&rsquo; &lsquo;As fat as a pig.&rsquo; &lsquo;No more sense
than a hog.&rsquo; Have you never heard such
expressions as these fall from the lips
of men? They shut us up in little dirty
pens where we must needs be lazy, since
we cannot run about. They continually
tempt us with food, and the more we eat
the better they like it, since it produces
the fat which they afterwards deride. If
we weary of dry corn or thin slop, and
break through some convenient hole
which their own carelessness has left,
and help ourselves to the tender cabbages
and peas of their gardens, they chase us
with yells and sticks and stones, and send
their dogs to make devilled ham of us before
we are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pun so amused the assembly that
they were convulsed with laughter. After
vainly waiting several minutes for silence
the hog returned calmly to his
place, convinced that he had at least presented
his grievances in a striking manner.</p>
<p>A handsome black Spanish rooster
strutted forward to the platform, and
stretching his neck, called the audience
to order with his clear-toned</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-do-you-do? I am the &lsquo;Cock-o&rsquo;-the-walk,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he explained, &ldquo;a term which
men are pleased to borrow and apply to
themselves. They rely upon me to give
them warning of the approach of day,
and then grumble because I disturb their
slumbers. How can they expect to wake
up without having their slumbers disturbed?
That&rsquo;s what I would like to
know. They rely upon me to eat the
worms and bugs and grasshoppers that
destroy their gardens, and then chase me
with stones and dogs when they find me
in their gardens doing my duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They pen me up, often for days at a
time, with insufficient food and water,
and do not even deign an apology for
their neglect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wives supply numerous eggs for
men&rsquo;s food, yet they wring our necks
without mercy if we venture to eat an
egg ourselves when they have forgotten
to feed us. &lsquo;As full as an egg is of
meat,&rsquo; is a comparison which might
properly be balanced with &lsquo;As full as a
man is of inconsistency.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If men would attend to their business
and scratch for a living as I do, the
world would be a far better place than
it is today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ended amid prolonged applause,
and walked proudly to a conspicuous
perch in the sunshine.</p>
<p>By this time there was much excitement
among the audience, who all signified
a desire to speak at once. While the
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
chairman was busy quieting them with
most vigorous barks, a monkey with
much agility made his way over the
heads of the audience, and leaped to the
platform, where he was ready to make
his profoundest bows to the assembly the
moment quiet reigned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may consider me an alien, since
I hail from a far country, yet I am truly
American&mdash;for even South America reveres
the Stars and Stripes,&rdquo; he said, and
his words were applauded by the very
ones who had but a moment previous
frowned at his audacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hold myself the superior of mankind
since many of their scientists assert
that the human race are but highly developed
monkeys. To be sure, a few
haughty fellows have lately declared that
monkeys are but the offspring of degenerate
men, but we monkeys resent such
assertions as uncalled-for insults. Why,
it is bad enough to have to endure the
thought that possibly&mdash;mind you, I say
possibly, not probably&mdash;possibly men
have descended from our race. There is
no monkey but what lives up to the best
of his God-given instincts, whereas, on
the other hand, there is no man that does
at all times the very best that he knows.
Therefore, by all the rules of logic, the
monkey is superior to the man, and must
be thus considered by all fair-minded
judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, however, is but a prologue to
my more serious remarks. I have only
been presenting my credentials to this
court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I now proceed to disclose my
plan for calling the attention of ungrateful
men to the benefactions we are daily
bestowing upon them?&rdquo; He paused and
bowed respectfully to the chairman and
then to the audience.</p>
<p>A thunder of applause greeted his
proposition, and the hall resounded with
cries of &ldquo;Good! good!&rdquo; &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; &ldquo;Three
cheers for Brother Monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When quiet was restored, the monkey
continued rapidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since my time is necessarily spent in
intimate association with men, I have
taken note of many of their schemes for
self-aggrandizement. The most popular
at the present time, is the Fair, where
everyone seeks to outdo his neighbor and
to proclaim his own superiority to the
whole world, while he exhibits his own
abilities and his own genius by a display
of his productions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what I propose is this: Let us
secure a convenient enclosure, and let
each family of birds and beasts and reptiles
erect a booth in which to display
the gifts which they are daily bestowing
upon mankind. Perhaps in this way the
hearts of men will be drawn to honor us,
and they will&mdash;after the ruling passion
of men&mdash;seek to advance their own interests
by favoring ours. Does my plan
meet with approval? If so, your humble
servant feels highly honored.&rdquo; He
placed his hand upon his heart and
bowed deeply to his audience, then, with
customary dexterity, returned to his
place as he had come, while the hall resounded
with prolonged applause.</p>
<p>The meeting was at once declared a
&ldquo;Committee of the Whole,&rdquo; and vigorous
plans were laid for the carrying out of
the monkey&rsquo;s scheme.</p>
<p>Because of his familiarity with such
places of resort, the monkey was elected
President of the Fair, an office which he
accepted with many expressions of humility,
and equally numerous feelings of
self-complacency.</p>
<p>Other officers and directors were
speedily appointed, the place for holding
the Fair selected, and the time set. Being
unacquainted with the red tape and
appropriation-grabbing customs of men,
the animals thus speedily brought their
business affairs to the working point,
and in the utmost harmony adjourned
to begin their preparations without delay.</p>

<h2 id="c10">THE BIRD AND THE MOUSE.</h2>
<p>Belonging to our household was a tiny
creature, Nixie, who from his gilded cage
between the lace curtains observed and
commented on all our actions. His door
was left open occasionally, and his gregariousness
moved him to go where he
could take part in conversations and see
people. He desired company even at
his bath; he had never heard of fear,
and won our hearts by his perfect trust.
Morning and evening we gave him first
salutation, and allowed him to pick our
fingers by way of shaking hands. Messages
came to him from over sea; gifts
fell to him at Christmas; in all our life
he had a part. And even the mouse made
its bow.</p>
<p>Our hearts had been softened toward
the &ldquo;wee, cow&rsquo;rin, timrous beasties&rdquo; by
a tender little tale of a parsonage mouse,
and we made friends with a gray visitor
that showed itself, now in the den at the
back of our house, now in the sitting
room in front. Because we took our
meals out, Monsieur Mousie&rsquo;s crumbs
were uncertain; but he investigated thoroughly
and managed to find a livelihood.
In our quiet rooms we often heard him
at his hunting, and smiled at thought of
his daring and industry. Twice he was
emptied out of the carpet-sweeper (he
must have fallen on very hard times at
those periods), but seemed none the
worse for the adventure, although the
manipulator of the sweeper was herself
much disturbed. The waste paper basket
finally became his cupboard, and peanut
shells his favorite fare. Often as we sat,
my brother smoking and I reading, we
would hear bits of paper rustling and
would know bright eyes were watching
us while sharp teeth nibbled the husks
we had saved for them. Daily, for a
month or two, the small thing came for
his share.</p>
<p>Alone in the room one Sunday evening,
I was lying on the couch reading
when I saw a little gray shadow steal out
and creep toward the waste paper basket.
I knew there was nothing in it, and lazily
felt for Mousie&rsquo;s disappointment. The
gray shadow stole back, halted by the
lace curtains, floated up them half way,
and stopped near Nixie&rsquo;s cage. I held
my breath. What next? Was he after
bird seed? Was this the explanation of
Nixie&rsquo;s empty cup that had perplexed
me the last week? But a peculiar, quick
chirp made me wonder if the bird were
afraid, if the mouse could get at and
hurt him. I raised my head and saw
the gray thing sitting on the seed cup
eating like one starved. Nixie was looking
at it, his wings wide spread, eyes
flashing, mouth wide open in protest,
body poised for attack. But the feast
went quietly on. Nixie gave a few sharp
questions and then settled down to study
his visitor.</p>
<p>It was too good to keep to myself; I
called my mother and brother and
whistled up the tube for neighbors to
join us in watching the strange scene.
By the time the audience was gathered
the actors were ready to play their parts.
Nixie went close to the seed dish and
chirped a welcome to his guest, then,
hopping backward, selected a station and
sang a sweet song for him. The mouse
seemed to like it. He left off his eating
and crept along outside the floor of the
cage, which extended a couple of inches
from the bars. Nixie within and Mousie
without promenaded together around the
four sides; and close together, too, Nixie
all the time gayly gossiping and chattering.
We say they kept it up for half
an hour, but that is a pretty long time.
At any rate it was several minutes.</p>
<p>How the acquaintance might have
ended I cannot say. The next day the
curtains were taken down and Mousie,
sadly disappointed, had no ladder by
which to climb. And later in the week
Nixie went out of town for the summer.
We wanted to take the mouse, too, but
the noise the packers and movers made
probably frightened him to such an extent
that he dared not show himself. We
do not know what his future was, but we
trust it was crowned with the success
due pluck and gentleness.</p>

<h2 id="c11">THE GRASSHOPPER SPARROW.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Ammodramus savannarum passerinus.</i>)</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the bird voices of the meadow, for its interesting originality and its effect in
ensemble, we can least spare that of the little Grasshopper Sparrow.&mdash;<span class="sc">R. M. Silloway</span>, in
&ldquo;Sketches of Some Common Birds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This little bird of the meadow and
hayfield is quite easily identified by the
marked yellow color at the shoulders of
the wings, the yellowish color of the
lesser wing coverts, the buff colored
breast and the orange colored line before
the eyes. Its home is on the ground,
where its retiring habits lead it to seek
the protecting cover of tall grass and
other herbage. As it is not often seen
except when flushed or when it rises to
the rail of a fence or to the top of a tall
spear of grass to utter its peculiar song,
it is often considered rare. It is, however,
a common bird in many localities
of its range, which covers the whole of
eastern North America, where it builds,
upon the ground, its nest of grass lined
with hair and a few feathers. It nests as
far north as Massachusetts and Minnesota
and winters in the southern states
and the adjacent islands.</p>
<p>This bird was given the name Grasshopper
Sparrow from the fancied resemblance
of its weak cherup&mdash;&ldquo;a peculiar
monotonous song&rdquo;&mdash;to the shrilling produced
by the long-horned grasshopper.
However, the song often begins and ends
with a faint warble. Mr. Chapman
says that these notes &ldquo;may be written
pit t&uacute;ck zee-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Silloway writes at length and enthusiastically
of the Grasshopper Sparrow.
He says, &ldquo;To the sympathetic ear
the voice of the humble Grasshopper
Sparrow is as necessary to the harmony
of the meadow overture as the clear piping
of the meadow lark or the jingling
triangle of the bobolink. The leading
instruments of the orchestra usually receive
our attention, yet the accompanying
pieces are chiefly responsible for the resulting
harmony. Taken alone, the notes
of the minor parts are harsh and unmelodious,
but sounded in time and accord
with the cornet, the first violin, and the
double bass, they assist in producing an
effect delightful and harmonious. Thus
it is with the voices of our little accompanist
in the mottled brown coat. Heard
alone at close station, it is seemingly
shrill and unmusical; but in the midst of
expanded verdure, following the lead of
the meadow voices, its noonday crooning
produces a dreamy harmony perfectly
in accord with the thoughts of the listener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name of this little bird is not only
appropriate because of its song but also
on account of its food. In the examination
of one hundred and seventy stomachs,
Dr. Sylvester D. Judd found that
the contents contained sixty-three per
cent of animal matter, twenty-three per
cent of which consisted of the remains of
grasshoppers. His investigations covered
a period of eight months. Thus during
that period these insects formed nearly
one-fourth of the total diet of the birds
examined. He also discovered that during
the month of June, the greatest number
of grasshoppers was eaten and
formed about sixty per cent of the stomach
contents.</p>
<p>In rural districts it is seldom called a
sparrow and is more commonly called
Grass-bird, Ground-bird or Grasshopper-bird.
Another appropriate name is Yellow-winged
Sparrow. All these names
well portray its habits and characteristics.
Its flights are short and rapid, but
&ldquo;on the ground or in the grass it runs
like meadow mice to elude the presence
and notice of intruders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Grasshopper Sparrow is an adept
in leading an intruder from the vicinity
of its nest. The male seldom utters its
song close by its brooding mate, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
either bird when disturbed in the vicinity
of their home will skulk through the
grass for some distance and, if necessity
of refuge requires flight, will rise from a
point sufficiently far away to mislead the
intruder.</p>
<p>Both sexes bear the responsibilities of
brooding and their home life seems to be
one round of contentment. &ldquo;Although
the male seeks to win the affections of his
lady love by persistently shrilling near
her the story of his passion he generally
represses his love trills near the home
which his mistress has established. * * *
Cheer her he must, however, and so he
trills throughout the day from fancied
situations within her hearing, yet safely
removed from the guarded spot.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c12">A HAPPY FAMILY.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Papa&rdquo; is now the name of our college
rooster, his hereditary name, however,
having been the &ldquo;Duke of Wellington,&rdquo;
since he always claimed that he descended
from renowned English stock. Be all
that as it may, he is a handsome bird of
portly proportions and of deep orange
and golden plumage. He sports a superb
mural crown and has brilliant eyes ever
on the watch for the welfare of his numerous
family of wives and children.
Altogether he is a domestic hero and
steps as proudly as ever Hector trod the
plains of ancient Troy, while his clarion
voice wakes the morning echoes for miles
around.</p>
<p>Now, the reason why our big rooster
is called Papa springs from quite a novel
circumstance all his own and which has
been for some time the town talk among
the Four Hundred of our poultry social
circles. The curious affair was strictly
in this wise: Late last fall, or, to be
more definite, about the middle of November,
one of our little hens, &ldquo;Biddy
the Bantam,&rdquo; stole her nest, as old housewives
would put it, in the adjoining
thicket, and in the fullness of time
brought off an even dozen as bright,
cherry chicks as ever gladdened the heart
of a mother partlet.</p>
<p>As soon as the chickens could nimbly
walk the provident hen led them to the
rear of the college kitchen to be properly
fed.</p>
<p>Now it may suffice to enhance the interest
of our story and perhaps make several
points more clearly understood by
the casual reader to say, or rather to
delicately intimate, sub rosa, of course,
that Biddy the Bantam was not the real
mother pure and simple of all the chickens
she had so industriously hatched and
brought off her fern embowered nest.
As it often happens in the best regulated
poultry yards, several other and bigger
hens had smuggled their own eggs into
Biddy&rsquo;s nest; a fact which would certainly
have been a foregone conclusion in
a few days from the difference in size of
the chickens if for no other reason. I
am sorry to say, however, that when the
truth leaked out it was an every day
scandal from one end of the poultry yard
to the other. But Biddy the Bantam, like
the brave little mother she was, pondered
these things in her heart, lived down the
wicked calumny and raised her family
despite the alleged illegitimacy of three
or four of the longer legged youngsters.</p>
<p>It was determined by the college authorities
that everything should be done
for the comfort of the rather untimely
brood notwithstanding the lateness of the
season and the threatened cold weather.
To this end mother and chicks were put
into a nice warm dry goods box with
plenty of soft hay for a bed, and the
whole establishment placed under the
south veranda of our main building.</p>
<p>Well, with plenty of food the chickens
grew, Biddy the Bantam was happy, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
all went along nicely till quite lately,
when the chickens, having become about
a quarter grown, it was discovered that
Biddy could not cover them all at the
same time, exert herself as best she
might. Hence on each frosty morning
it was evident that the chickens had
suffered a good deal during the night.
Their cries could be heard late at night
and early in the morning as they crowded
each other out into the bitter cold, the
stronger ones striving to secure the
warmest place under mamma&rsquo;s soft
feather coverlet.</p>
<p>Now a dire emergency had come and
something had to be done, and done it
was in a most mysterious manner; and
herein, also, is contained the gist of our
story. The grievous complaint of the
chickens came to a sudden discontinuation.
Did the little hen mother in her
deep affliction appeal to Sir Duke, the big
rooster, for advice and succor? The
sequel would certainly argue in favor of
such a conclusion, for now he comes regularly
every evening at early candle light,
squeezes his bulky form through the bars
of the coop, sits down by the side of
Biddy the Bantam and spreads his broad
wings over more than half of the chickens.
Peace, indeed, has returned and
there are no more family jars in that
little household.</p>
<p>It is a pleasant pastime to take a lantern
and make a social evening call at
the coop after Papa and Biddy have put
their children to sleep. The most amusing
thing of all is to hear the old rooster
talk to the chickens. Thus, if anything
goes wrong, any naughty crowding or
some little foot trodden upon so as to
cause an outcry, Papa slowly rises,
shakes out his feathers, readjusts his
great spreading toes, pokes in with his
beak any little protruding head and then
settles down again, all the while talking
and saying in plain chicken lingo,
&ldquo;There, little dears, now nestle down and
go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conclusion I will say to the readers
of <span class="sc">Birds and Nature</span> that this little
story is no fancy sketch but a true recital
of events that took place at Vashon College
while I was a member of the faculty
of that institution. The chanticleer of
every farmyard is a noble bird and a hero
in his own sovereign right.</p>

<h2 id="c13">THE DAMSEL FLY.</h2>
<p>This is a small insect&mdash;that is it is
smaller than some of the dragon flies, to
which order&mdash;Odonata&mdash;it belongs. It is
of more gentle habits and not so swift of
wing as the dragon fly. It was the
French writers who gave it the name it
bears, while some English authorities
placed it along with the dragons. Howard
says they are seldom found far from
the stream or pond where they are born,
yet I have two or three varieties that I
caught on the prairie some miles from
any water. Their wings are not held
horizontally, but are folded parallel with
their bodies. This facilitates the
backing down the stem of a plant or reed
when the female wishes to deposit her
eggs below the surface of the water,
which is usually the place for incubation.
The wings are gauze like, some nearly
black, others with a beautiful metallic
luster. They are not so savage as the
dragons, although one I took last summer
held on to the threads of the net
until it nearly severed them, and bit at
my fingers in a most savage manner.</p>

<h2 id="c14">FELDSPAR.</h2>
<p>Feldspar is the family name of several
minerals closely related and indeed
grading into each other, but distinguished
by mineralogists by separate specific
terms. These minerals are all silicates
of aluminum, with some alkali or alkali
earth, having a hardness of about 6 in
the scale in which quartz is 7 and a
specific gravity varying from 2.5 to 2.7.
They are fusible with difficulty before
the blowpipe, crystallize in the monoclinic
or triclinic system and cleave in two
well-marked directions nearly or quite at
right angles to each other. It is this
latter property, probably, which led to
the grouping of these minerals as spar,
since this term is applied in common
language to any minerals which break
with bright crystalline surfaces. Thus
calc spar is a common name for calcite,
heavy spar for barite, needle spar for
aragonite, and so on. The term field
spar, of which Feldspar is probably a
corruption, was perhaps given the minerals
of this group because of their
widespread occurrence. The English
spelling of the word is Felspar. The
Feldspars form an essential part of
nearly all eruptive rocks and by their decomposition
produce clays and other soils
which may harden into great areas of
sedimentary rocks. They are thus of
great geological importance and interest.
Usually the white crystals to be seen in
an eruptive rock in contrast to the dark
green or black of the pyroxene or hornblende,
or the glassy, nearly colorless
quartz, are Feldspar. The Feldspar may,
however, contain more or less iron and
then take on a flesh color or become even
darker. Feldspar crystals can best be
recognized by their prominent cleavage,
which appears as numerous bright flat
surfaces extending in any given crystal
in the same direction. The crystals,
while they may be of so minute dimensions
as to be visible only with the microscope,
may on the other hand reach in
veins in coarse-grained granites a length
of a foot or more.</p>
<p>As ornamental stones only certain
varieties of Feldspar are valued and
their value depends on accidents of color
or structure. The first of the Feldspars
which may be mentioned as being prized
as an ornamental stone is amazonstone
or green Feldspar. This in composition
is what is called a potash Feldspar,
potash being the alkali which in combination
with alumina and silica goes
to make up the mineral. The percentages
of each in a pure amazonstone are
silica 64.7, alumina 18.4 and potash 16.9.
The mineralogical name of the species
is micro-cline, meaning small inclination,
and refers to the fact that the angle between
the two cleavages of the mineral is
not quite a right angle. The common
color of microcline is white to pale yellow,
but occasionally green and red occur.</p>
<p>It is only to the green variety that the
name of amazonstone is applied, a name
meaning stone from the Amazon river.
It first referred probably to jade or some
such green stone from that locality and
then came to include green Feldspar. No
occurrence of green Feldspar in that
region is now known.</p>
<p>Practically all the amazonstone now
used for ornamental purposes comes
from three localities. These are the
vicinity of Miask in the Ural Mountains,
Pike&rsquo;s Peak, Colorado, and Amelia Court
House, Virginia. In all these places the
amazonstone occurs in coarse-grained
granite and is closely accompanied by
quartz and Feldspar. All gradations
are found in color from the deep green
to white, only the bright green being
prized for ornamental purposes. The
Feldspar is usually well crystallized and
crystals of several pounds weight may
be found. A crystal will rarely be
of a uniform color, streaks of paler
green or white being commonly present.
Only the uniformly colored portions are
prized for ornamental purposes. The
green often takes on a bluish tone and
blue sometimes even predominates. The
color is doubtless due to some organic
matter, as it disappears, leaving the
stone white, on heating. The stone is always
opaque. Its use is not extensive,
its sale being greater to tourists in the
vicinity of the regions where it is found
than to gem cutters. Several other
localities in the United States besides
those mentioned afford the mineral,
though not in large quantities. It occurs
in two or three localities in North
Carolina; in Paris, Maine; Mount
Desert, Maine; Rockport, Massachusetts;
and Delaware county, Pennsylvania.
The finest comes from the Pike&rsquo;s
Peak locality. Mr. G. F. Kunz states in
regard to these crystals that when they
were first exhibited at the Centennial
Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 they
were a great surprise to Russian dealers
who had brought over some amazonstone
from the Urals, expecting to sell it at
what would now be considered fabulously
high prices.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The second species of Feldspar which
may be mentioned as of use as an ornamental
stone is labradorite. This differs
in composition from amazonstone in
containing soda and lime in place of potash,
the percentages in a typical labradorite
being, silica 53.7, alumina 29.6,
lime 11.8 and soda 4.8. Labradorite has
the typical cleavage of Feldspar and
cleavage surfaces in the direction of
easiest cleavage are usually marked by
rows of parallel striae. These show that
the mass is made up of a series of crystal
twins in parallel position and afford an
excellent criterion for determining a
triclinic Feldspar. Labradorite is a
common rock-forming mineral, especially
in the older rocks. It is only, however,
when it occurs in large pieces
which exhibit a play of colors that it is
prized as an ornamental stone. The
labradorite exhibiting the latter property
in the most remarkable degree and
hence most valued is that found on the
coast of Labrador near Nain and the
adjacent island of St. Paul. It was first
found here by a Moravian missionary
named Wolfe and brought to Europe in
the year 1775. It occurs together with
the form of pyroxene known as hypersthene,
in a coarse-grained granite, or
perhaps a gneiss. From these it is
weathered out by wave and atmospheric
action and occurs as beach pebbles. It
is also mined from veins. Labradorite
of pleasing color and opalescence occurs
in a few other localities in Canada, and
in Essex county, New York, in the
United States. Two localities occur in
Russia, one near St. Petersburg and
the other in the region of Kiew. The
labradorite of the latter locality is the
better, its occurrence being in a coarse-grained
gabbro. The Labrador occurrence
exceeds all others, however, in
abundance and beauty and by far the
larger quantity used in the arts comes
from there. The play of colors which
gives labradorite its attractiveness is
rarely seen to advantage except upon a
polished surface, but whether polished
or unpolished it only appears when the
surface is held at a particular angle with
reference to the eye. Emerson thus describes
it in his essay on Experience as
illustrating the limitations of the individual:
&ldquo;A man is like a bit of Labrador
spar, which has no lustre as you turn it
in your hand until you come to a particular
angle; then it shows deep and
beautiful colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The play of colors seen in labradorite
is not like that of the opal, which presents
to the eye fragments of different
colors varying in different positions, but
appears as broad surfaces of a single
color. It is only rarely that these colors
change with a change of position. Bauer
remarks that the appearance is similar
to that seen on the wings of some tropical
butterflies. The colors over any
given surface are not necessarily alike,
but more than two or three tints are rare.
Each tint is uniform where it occurs. A
surface may be interspersed with many
spots exhibiting no sheen. Both colored
and uncolored portions have only vague
outlines and merge into each other at the
edges. Bauer mentions a labradorite
from Russia the colored portions of
which formed a striking likeness of
Louis XVI, the head being a beautiful
blue against a gold green background,
while above appeared a beautiful garnet
red crown. Excellent effects are sometimes
produced in labradorite by cutting
it in the form of cameos so as to
make the base of different color from
the figure in relief. Of the different
colors shown by labradorite blue and
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
green are the most common, yellow and
red least so. These colors are regarded
by Vogelsang as of different origin, the
blue being, in his opinion, a polarization
phenomenon due to the lamellar structure
of the Feldspar, and the yellows and
reds the result of the reflection of light
from minute included crystals of magnetite,
hematite and ilmenite. These lying
in parallel position in great numbers
in the labradorite give the colors.</p>
<p>The gems known as moonstone and
sunstone owe the play of colors which
gives them their respective names to
similar causes. These gems are generally
some form of Feldspar, although any
mineral giving a similar sheen of color
might be included under them. The
moonstone of commerce comes chiefly
from Ceylon, where it occurs in large
pieces the size of a fist in a clay resulting
from the decomposition of a porphyritic
rock. Pieces of these when
polished exhibit the beautiful pale blue
light coming from within which makes
the stone prized as a gem. The cause of
this light is undoubtedly minute tabular
crystals lying in parallel position through
the stone.</p>
<p>The stone varies from translucent to
opaque, and from colorless to white, the
essential feature being the blue opalescent
light or chatoyancy exhibited from
a polished surface. Good moonstones
are worth from three to five dollars a
carat.</p>
<p>The Ceylon moonstone is sometimes
known as Ceylon opal, but it is the variety
of Feldspar known as orthoclase,
which is a potash Feldspar, differing
from the microcline just described in
being monoclinic in crystallization and
in having two cleavages meeting at right
angles. Another species of Feldspar
used as moonstone is albite. This is a
soda Feldspar and is triclinic, but exhibits
the color characteristic of moonstone.
One variety is known as peristerite, from
the Greek word for pigeon, and is applied
on account of the resemblance of
the sheen to that of a pigeon&rsquo;s neck. It
is found at Macomb, St. Lawrence county,
New York. Albite found at Mineral
Hill, Pennsylvania, also exhibits the
chatoyancy of moonstone. Amelia Court
House, Virginia, is another locality
whence come pieces either of orthoclase
or oligoclase exhibiting this property.
Like most of the more or less opaque
gems, moonstone is cut chiefly in the
rounded form known as en cabochon. It
is of late, however, cut in the form of
balls, which are quite popular, the bringing
of good luck being attributed to them.
The brilliancy of moonstone is considerably
increased by mounting it against
black.</p>
<p>Sunstone is the term by which those
kinds of Feldspar are known which reflect
a spangled yellow light. The appearance
comes from minute crystals of
iron oxide, hematite or gothite, which are
included in the stone and both reflect the
light and give it a reddish color. Like
labradorite the sheen is visible only when
the stone is held at a certain angle. Some
specimens of the mineral carnallite, which
is a chloride of potassium and magnesium,
exhibit a similar sheen, and being
soluble in water the crystals of hematite
can be separated out. They are then
seen to be perfect little hexagons of a
blood-red color. The sheen of sunstone
is best visible when the stone is held in
the sunlight or strong artificial light.
The variety of Feldspar to which the sunstone
most in use at the present time belongs
is oligoclase, a soda-lime triclinic
Feldspar. Like labradorite it usually exhibits
on the surface of easiest cleavage
parallel striations due to twinning structure.
The best sunstone at the present
time comes from Tvedestrand, in southern
Norway, where it occurs in compact
masses together with white quartz, in
veins, in gneiss. Some also comes from
Hittero, Norway. In Werchne Udinsk,
Siberia, another occurrence was discovered
in 1831. Previous to this Bauer
states that all the sunstone known came
from the Island of Sattel in the White
Sea, and was very costly, although of a
quality which would not now be deemed
desirable. At the present time, although
stones of fine quality can be obtained,
sunstone is little used in jewelry, and its
market value is very low. Statesville,
North Carolina, and Delaware county,
Pennsylvania, are two localities in the
United States where good sunstone has
been obtained.</p>
<p>Both sunstone and moonstone can be
accurately imitated in glass and the distinction
of the artificial from the real by
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
ocular examination alone would be almost
impossible. Glass, however, lacks
the cleavage of Feldspar and is somewhat
heavier and softer. The discovery
of the method of making artificial
sunstone is said to have been accidental,
and was made at Murano, near Venice,
when a quantity of brass filings by chance
fell into a pot of melted glass. The product
was for a long time and is still used
in the arts under the name of goldstone.
Sunstone is sometimes known as aventurine
Feldspar, in distinction from aventurine
quartz, which presents a similar appearance,
owing to the inclusion of scales
of mica. The term aventurine is from
the Italian avventura, meaning chance,
and refers to the chance discovery above
referred to.</p>
<p>Gems are occasionally cut from other
forms of Feldspar than those here described,
which are transparent and colorless
and valued for their lustre. The
varieties chiefly employed in this manner
are adularia, a variety of orthoclase which
is often transparent, the best specimens
being obtained in Switzerland, and oligoclase,
in the transparent form in which
it is found near Bakersville, North Carolina.</p>

<h2 id="c16">THE COTTAGE BY THE WOOD.</h2>
<p>It was my good fortune to spend some
months in a cozy little cottage in a suburban
district, the natural surroundings
of which were such as to at once appeal
to a naturalist, aside from furnishing
ample opportunity for rest and quiet.
The large lawn belonging to the property,
with its abundance of shade trees,
fronted on the main avenue of a populous
corporate town, while in the rear
was a strip of woodland, which in turn
was bordered by a clearing covered mainly
by briars and thick low bushes, its
whole length being intersected by a
winding brook.</p>
<p>Birds in the locality were quite numerous
and some of them showed remarkable
tameness. During the hours of night
time, giving voice as it were to the weird
lights and shadows around the house, we
could hear the mournful ditty of a
screech owl whose home was in a nearby
hickory tree, while the first gray streak
of each returning dawn was heralded by
the sweet songs of the robins. Flickers
were frequently seen hopping around in
the grass near the roots of various trees;
the notes of the yellow-billed cuckoo
were also heard in the thick foliage of
the maples: redeyed vireos kept up a continual
warbling all day long and doubtless
had a nest in the vicinity, as we observed
the mother bird feeding two very
young ones; the latter being perched in
a low bush in the yard. The happy song of
the house wrens was always in evidence
and three nests were built under the
porch roof. I personally observed one
of the broods leaving the nest and was
surprised to see two of their number
climb up the straight trunk of a wild
cherry tree&mdash;genuine woodpecker fashion&mdash;for
a distance of twelve or fifteen
feet, where the limbs began to branch
out. However, they arrived at the top
safely and remained there for the balance
of the day.</p>
<p>Humming birds often came and hovered
over the many beautiful flowers in
the yard, and sometimes consented to
alight for a few minutes for our benefit.
On one of these occasions a party of five
(including my baby daughter) approached
to within three feet of the
flower stalk upon which our little visitor
was perched; still it sat there, turning
its wee head this way and that, looking
at us with fearless unconcern. At last
it gave a sharp chirp, flew, and was soon
lost to sight. On one occasion in the
early morning, we were greeted with the
familiar call &ldquo;Bob White,&rdquo; which seemed
to come from the woods in the rear of
the yard. The call was repeated several
times, but we were unable to discover
the author of it. A tree of fine red
cherries proved a great attraction for
cat birds and other feathered fruit lovers.
But what we considered the greatest
privilege, and one which was exceedingly
enjoyed, was the daily greeting of the
wood thrushes during the breakfast hour.
What could be more charming than to
sit leisurely eating the morning meal and
all the while listening to the sweet, clear
strains of the loveliest bird songs pouring
from the throats of the russet-brown
vocalists just outside the kitchen window,
peal after peal, in endless volume
and variation. In addition to the birds
already mentioned we sometimes heard
the shrill scream of the blue jay, also the
notes of the king birds and crested flycatchers,
while from the distance, floating
to us from across some field or
meadow, came the morning praises of
a meadow lark or the well known call
of the kildeer. The crows also added
their deep caw-caw-caw to the chorus
of woodland voices. The clearing above
referred to proved to be the home of two
or three species of the warbler family,
and a walk through the vicinity the following
winter revealed a number of
nests. They were all placed low, and
one of them showed every indication of
having been built and occupied by an
oven bird.</p>
<p>The usual wild flowers of the season
were abundant and the surrounding
country at large was admirably suited
for exploration and research; hence our
sojourn at the &ldquo;Cottage&rdquo; was one of
great pleasure and instruction.</p>

<h2 id="c17">A NEW ARGYNNIS.</h2>
<p>The butterfly to which I want to introduce
you is a rare beauty! It is called
Argynnis nitocris nigrocaerulea by scientists,
but the young people of our school
call it the blue-black silver spot or the
Sapello Fritillary. They wanted very
much to name it after the Territory, but
unfortunately there is a butterfly of this
genus that bears the name of New Mexico
Silver-spot.</p>
<p>Every member of the genus Argynnis
is beautiful and it is a great treat to see
the glint of the silver dotted wings of
these butterflies as they hover about the
gaily colored flowers in some mountain
canyon or alpine meadow. But no member
of the genus will compare in beauty
with the female of the nigrocaerulea, and
I should find difficulty in forgetting the
pleasure I felt in seeing two of these
lovely creatures sucking the nectar from
a large bright colored Rudbeckia.</p>
<p>The nigrocaerulea is very much like
a silver-spot that is found in the mountains
of Arizona; both belong to the species
nitocris and there is still a third form
found in the mountains of Mexico. It is
very likely that these forms were the
same years ago, but the mountains in
this arid region are like islands, and are
separated by dry expanses upon which
an Argynnis could not live. It follows,
therefore, that in the isolated mountain
regions many forms of the same species
may be found, and when the country has
been more carefully explored we shall
very probably find other varieties of nitocris.</p>
<p>The nigrocaerulea was discovered in
August, 1900, in the Sapello Canyon, a
beautiful canyon in the Rocky Mountains
near Las Vegas, New Mexico. The male
is reddish-fulvous on the upper surface,
with well defined markings consisting
of waved transverse lines and crescent
shaped spots. On the under side
the design of the fore wings is somewhat
indistinctly repeated, and the base is colored
with a most exquisite reddish pink.
The under surface of the hind wings is
a rich brown with a wide yellow border,
and is profusely marked with spots of
glistening silver. The female on the upper
side is bluish black, well marked near
the margin by large spots of yellow suffused
with blue. The under surface is
very like that of the male, though the colors
are more pronounced, the brown in the
hind wing merging into black. The Sapello
Fritillary flies during the month of
August. Though the caterpillar is not
known, it is supposed to feed upon the
leaves of violets, which grow very
abundantly in the Sapello Canyon. Diligent
search will be made for it, and I am
sure all will be interested if at some
future time I can give the history and picture
of the chrysalis of this beautiful
Silver-spot.</p>

<h2 id="c20">A PROLIFIC PEACH TREE STUMP.</h2>
<p>One day early in the spring, while taking
bird notes I discovered a pair of
chickadees busily engaged in constructing
a home. They had chosen an old
peach tree that stood just back of the
yard and were rapidly excavating a beautifully
rounded circle in the decayed
stump.</p>
<p>Perching in the mouth of the cavity
the chickadee&rsquo;s body would almost disappear
within and then he would withdraw
himself and fly away with a tiny
chip of rotten wood in his beak. After
the cavity was satisfactorily completed
they began lining the interior, which
formed the nest proper. These fastidious
little feathered architects consider
nothing less than soft clean fur suitable
material for a bed for their delicate
speckled eggs. In this instance rabbit&rsquo;s

fur was used, which was identified
by the fringe of loose hair that clung
to the entrance, for the hollow was too
deep to look down into the nest.</p>
<p>Some time after the discovery of the
chickadees&rsquo; habitation, when the peaches
and plums were in blossom and the air
soft and balmy the wrens arrived from
their winter home.</p>
<p>These inquisitive little creatures peer
out very knowingly from their retreat
amidst the verdure, at anyone who comes
near, and they win the heart of all by
their pert manners and love of human
companionship. These modestly attired
little warblers are extremely lively and
nimbly search among the foliage for
food, destroying many harmful insects.</p>
<p>In scanning every possible and impossible
place about the premises for a suitable
nesting site, one of these dapper
little fellows spied the snuggery in the
stump which captivated his fancy, and
he forthwith proceeded to try to take
possession. But such outrageous trespassing
was not to be allowed for a
moment by the chickadees and whenever
the little brown rogue crept up to the
entrance to peep in, out would pop the
proprietor, in his jaunty black cap, and
put him to flight. The intruder would
then perch on a branch near by, stretch
himself to his full height, with tail erect,
as though to appear of as much consequence
as possible, and alternately scold
and pour forth defiant song at his opponent.
This antagonism was kept up
for several days, till finally the wrens
gave up the contest and began furnishing
a neat little bird house in a maple
tree close by.</p>
<p>When they had nearly completed their
labor the young chickadees left the nest
to follow their sprightly parents about
the orchard, whereupon the whimsical
but industrious wrens immediately abandoned
their pretty summer cottage to
occupy the now vacant cavity in the
stump. These two little birds (chickadee
and wren), much alike in some respects,
show a very decided difference
in the choice of nesting material. The
hollow was soon filled to overflowing
with sticks, the main substance of every
wren&rsquo;s nest.</p>
<p>In due season a brood issued forth,
followed by another later, to swell the
young bird population, then at its height.
Only think of the amount of extravagant
activity and drollery that was reared
in that cavity nursery!</p>
<p>As the Creator did not implant the
migratory instinct, except in the very
slightest measure in the chickadee&rsquo;s nature,
his travels are mostly local and his
spruce little form may be seen in all seasons.
During the fall and winter, after
the fidgety wrens have departed for the
sunny southland, is the most favorable
time to study the habits of the chickadee.
His actions may then be observed
most readily, as he flits among the bare
branches in search of prey, occasionally
taking time to utter his cheerful chick-adee-dee.</p>
<p>He is a great aid to the fruit grower.
Let anyone that doubts this repair to an
orchard and observe a company of them
taking their meals. And it is an interesting
sight to watch a merry party of these
little creatures, as with never-ceasing activity
they dexterously explore the trees
for food. With the greatest nicety they
poise in every conceivable attitude; from
the trunk they dart to the topmost spray,
now to the center of the tree and then
instantly to the outside branches. While
searching the trunk or a perpendicular
branch, the head may be upward or the
reverse; or if a horizontal branch is undergoing
examination his feet are as
likely to point heavenward as not; or he
may hang suspended from a swaying
twig. Ever in motion, flitting, hopping,
swinging to and fro, they investigate
every nook and cranny and draw numberless
injurious insects, their eggs and
larvae from their lurking places. The
chickadee&rsquo;s tongue, a fork-shaped instrument,
is admirably adapted to prying
its prey out of crevices of bark.</p>
<p>They by no means confine their work
to the orchard, but all kinds of trees and
shrubs are alike visited. In thus performing
the duty assigned them by Nature
they are of inestimable service to
man.</p>

<h2 id="c21">THE COWRIES AND SHELL MONEY.</h2>
<p>Among marine mollusks none stand so
favorably in the eyes of collectors or are
so beautiful as the Cypraeas, or Cowry
shells. With their glossy coats and varied
colors they are indeed gems of the ocean,
and it is little wonder that the conchologist
has placed them first among the
many families of marine shells.</p>
<p>The name Cypraea comes from Cypris,
one of the names of the goddess Venus.
About two hundred recent species have
been described and they are found in
nearly all parts of the world, though
more numerous in the tropics and sub-tropics,
where they live on coral reefs
and under rocks. As in many other
genera of shells the Cowries living in the
tropics are more brilliantly colored than
those from more temperate climes, a
condition due to the large amount of sunshine
and high temperature, both of these
factors being essential to the secretion of
color in the pigment cells of the animal.</p>
<p>The animal which inhabits a Cowry
shell is a curiosity. The foot is large
and spreads out in a wide mass, enabling
the animal to glide along quite rapidly.
The mantle lobes are folded over the
back of the shell and are beset with many
little tuft-like organs which stick out
like young shoots on a plant. The
mouth is placed at the end of a rather
long snout or rostrum and the eyes are
upon the outside of two long, tapering
tentacles, about one-third the distance
from the body. When the shell is young
it is covered with a thin epidermis and
has a thin, sharp outer lip, like some
snails, but when it is full grown the
outer lip rolls inward, becomes toothed or
ridged, as does also the inner lip, and
the aperture becomes a long and narrow
slit reaching from the apex to the
base of the shell. The mantle lobes,
which are inconspicuous in the young
shell, becomes larger and are reflected
over the back, depositing coat after coat
of shelly enamel until the first pattern of
the shell, as well as the epidermis, is covered
with a secondary, shining coat. On
most Cypraeas there is a line of paler
color, showing where the two lobes of
the mantle meet on the back.</p>
<p>Like many other mollusks the Cypraea
is able to dissolve the internal whorls and
thus enlarge the capacity of its shell.
This is also true of Conus, and Murex,
and some other marine snails dissolve
the spines which may be in the way when
increasing the size of the whorls. The
older naturalists, Lamarck and Bruguiere,
believed that the Cypraea was able
to dissolve its outer lip after it had been
rolled over and toothed, but this theory
has been proved to be incorrect. They
founded their belief on the fact that some
individuals of the same species were
larger than others. This, however, is due
simply to individual variation.</p>
<p>The beautiful colors so much admired
are deposited by the reflected mantle and
their variety is almost endless. Some
are perfectly plain, white, brownish, yellowish
or orange, others are spotted with
red, white, brown, drab or black, and
still others are variously banded. The
eyed-cowry (Cypraea argus) has large,
dark brown spots on a lighter background.</p>
<p>In form and sculpture the Cowries present
a rather wide range of variation.
The typical form is more or less cylindrical,
or pyriform, while others are flat,
oval or egg-shaped. The surface varies
from smooth to spirally lined and pustulose.
In size they vary from the little
Trivia exigua, scarcely one-fourth of an
inch long, to the huge Cypraea testudinaria,
nearly five inches in length.</p>
<p>Many of the larger species, like the
tiger cowry (Cypraea tigris) and the
black cowry (Cypraea mauritiana) have
been household ornaments for centuries
and have also served as playthings for
young children, who have held them to
their ears to &ldquo;hear the sound of the
roaring sea.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>In habits the Cowries are shy and they
are slow in movement, sliding over the
coral reefs and marine vegetation with a
sluggish, steady motion. They present
a beautiful sight when viewed through
the water, their brilliant colors vying
with those of corals, sea anemones and
sea weeds. They are said to feed principally
upon the coral animals.</p>
<p>From very ancient times the smaller
Cowries have been used for adornment
or barter. The Cypraea annulus, or
ringed cowrie, which was found by Dr.
Layard in the ruins of Nimroud, is said
to be the same species which is now used
by the islanders of the Indian and Pacific
Oceans to weight their fish nets and to
adorn their persons. In western Africa
the money cowry (Cypraea moneta) has
been and is now used as a medium of
exchange in place of gold. Many tons
were yearly shipped to England from
the Indian and Pacific Oceans, to be
again carried to Africa to barter with
the natives for ivory and other articles.</p>
<p>The number of Cowries which have
been given for various articles, with their
value in American currency, is interesting.
Thus it is recorded by the Conchologist
Reeve that a gentleman residing at
Cuttack in India paid for the building of
his bungalow entirely in Cowries, giving
over sixteen million specimens. The
value of these Cowries was four thousand
rupees sicca in Indian money, or
about two thousand dollars in American
money. In another place it is recorded
that a young wife cost from sixty thousand
to one million Cowries, or from
about nineteen dollars to thirty-seven
dollars, while an ordinary wife cost but
twenty thousand shells or about six dollars.</p>
<p>The value of Cowries varies in different
countries. In India five or six thousand
may be purchased for one rupee,
while in parts of Africa two hundred
Cowries are worth sixteen cents. In
Sudan, two thousand Cowries, which
weigh about seven pounds, are worth
one dollar. On the west coast of Africa,
where trading in Cowries is largely carried
on, the following gradation of value
is recorded by Dr. Stearns:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">40 Cowries = 1 string.</p>
<p class="t0">2&frac12; strings = 1 pence.</p>
<p class="t0">100 Cowries = 1 pence.</p>
<p class="t0">50 strings = 1 head of Cowries.</p>
<p class="t0">10 heads = 1 bag.</p>
<p class="t0">2,000 Cowries = 1 head.</p>
<p class="t0">3 heads = 1 dollar.</p>
<p class="t0">20,000 Cowries = 1 bag.</p>
</div>
<p>In other places the value is about 1s.
3d. for 1,000 shells.</p>
<p>The money cowry is also used as ornaments
on the trappings of horses and
elephants, as well as on the persons of
men and women. The rich yellow variety
is much sought after by the chiefs
of several island tribes, who permit no
one but themselves or their sub-chiefs to
wear them.</p>
<p>We may truly say that of all the mollusks,
large or small, handsome or ugly,
the modest little money cowry surpasses
any in point of economical importance.</p>
<p>In the Friendly Islands the orange
cowry (Cypraea aurantia) is used as a
badge of chieftainship and for a long
time specimens were almost priceless because
no one but the chief was allowed
to wear this ornament. Specimens of
this species are frequently seen in collections,
with a hole in the back by means
of which it was suspended about the neck
of the native chief.</p>
<p>Those who have described the Cowries
have given them many fanciful names,
some of which, however, are quite appropriate.
Thus we have the caput serpentis
or serpent&rsquo;s head; the arabica or Arab
shell, so named from the peculiar, hieroglyphic-like
characters on its back; the
lynx, pantherina and tigris, each shell
resembling the coat of the lynx, panther
and tiger; mus, the rat shell; rhinoceros,
the rhinoceros shell; turdus the thrush,
and cervus the deer. Many of the other
names are equally well chosen, as moppa
the mop cowry, and pustulata the pustulose
cowry.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the prices that
have been paid for rare specimens of this
family. At an auction held in London many
years ago a specimen of Cypraea guttata
brought two hundred dollars, and Cypraea
princeps, another very rare shell,
brought the same price. Cypraea umbilicata
once sold for one hundred and
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
fifty dollars, but may now be had for five
dollars. Aurantia, the orange cowry,
was once almost priceless, but is now
sold at from twenty to forty dollars. Some
of the lesser rarities are Cypraea scoltii,
worth from five to eight dollars, and Cypraea
decipiens, worth from fifteen to
twenty dollars. These extravagant prices
need not be paid by any one desiring a
collection of these pretty shells, for the
price of a single rarity will suffice to purchase
the majority of the common species.
Several private collections in the
United States contain from one hundred
fifty to one hundred seventy species, including
a number of the rarities spoken
of above.</p>
<p>In connection with the Cypraeas it is
interesting to notice other species of shell
money which have been used as money.
The North American Indians used fragments
of shells for money, which they
called wampum. In New England wampum
was in the form of beads, the manufacture
of which required considerable
skill. These beads were cylindrical in
form, about one-fourth of an inch long
and half as wide. They were of two
colors and were drilled and strung on
long cords.</p>
<p>The quahog (Venus mercenaria) was
much used in the manufacture of shell
money because of its two decided colors,
pure white and deep purple. The white
beads were called wampum or wompom
and the black beads suckauhock, or
black money. In addition to the quahog
the whelk Buccinum and the &ldquo;periwinkle&rdquo;
or &ldquo;winkle&rdquo; were used, the long,
white columella being cut from the shell
and made into beads.</p>
<p>We learn from some of the older records
that in Massachusetts the wampum
was valued at three beads to a penny or
five shillings for a fathom. The fathom
varied in size according to the number
of beads allowed by law as an equivalent
to a penny. If this was six, then the
fathom contained three hundred and sixty
beads, but if the number was four,
then the fathom was composed of two
hundred forty beads. Owing to the
counterfeiting of wampum by the whites,
who could make it much quicker with
their tools than could the Indians, the
value rapidly fell in later years and its
use was finally discontinued.</p>
<p>On the coast of California the tooth or
tusk shells, Dentalium, were used as
money, being strung together as were
the beads of the New England Indians.
Those of the better quality were called
Phai-Kwa or hi-qua and represented the
highest standard of money. One hi-qua
would purchase one male or two female
slaves. The damaged or defective shells
were called kop-kops, forty of which
equalled one hi-qua in value. At one
time a single hi-qua was equal in value
to about two hundred fifty dollars. Other
shells were also used on the Pacific coast,
some of which were simply strung in the
form of beads while others were cut from
large shells. One of the latter was from
the large clam, Pachydesma crassatelloides,
and the pieces were called hawock
or ha-wok, their value ranging from four
to twenty-five cents. Another clam used
was the Saxidomus aratus.</p>
<p>The little Olivella biplicata was used
for beads and was called hol-kol. They
were made by grinding off the apex,
which left a hole through the top of
the shell. The Haliotis or abalone was
also used and was called uhl-lo. Pieces
of the shell one or two inches in length
were cut from the flat part of the abalone,
a hole was drilled in one end and
they were strung like beads. Their value
was one dollar each, or ten dollars for a
string of ten pieces. Like the shell money
of New England that of the Pacific coast
was counterfeited by the whites and for
this reason the value of the native currency
soon declined.</p>

<h2 id="c22">THE BIRD OF SUPERSTITION.</h2>
<p>There are several possible reasons why
the owl has always been regarded as an
ominous bird. Something uncanny seems
to inhere in its noiseless flight, something
unearthly to look out from its large,
strange eyes. Even its voice arouses an
eerie feeling, which is increased by the
knowledge of its nocturnal habits. The
poets are fond of alluding to its auguries
of evil, Shakespeare alone finding a
merry note in its &ldquo;Tu-whit, tu-whoo,&rdquo;
and even he added an &ldquo;owlet&rsquo;s ring&rdquo; to
the noisome ingredients of the witches&rsquo;
cauldron in Macbeth. He also speaks of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">The fatal bellman</p>
<p class="t0">That givest the stern&rsquo;st good night.</p>
</div>
<p>Chaucer speaks of the screech owl as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The prophet of woe and of mischance,</p>
</div>
<p>while Spencer alludes to&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The whistler shrill, that whoso hears doth die.</p>
</div>
<p>Roman soothsayers were accustomed
to use owls&rsquo; feathers in their incantations.
In many places its note is still considered
a sure sign of impending death. In Borneo,
it is said, that if a person on entering
a forest hears the voice of an owl,
he will at once return. The Mexicans,
Indians and Basque shepherds regard
the monkey-faced owl as an omen of ill-luck.</p>
<p>There is a story that Agrippa was so
superstitious that when he beheld an owl
perched over him on the occasion when
the people shouted, &ldquo;It is not the voice
of a man, but of a God!&rdquo; that he felt
assured of the speedy death which followed.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, instead of a
prophet of evil, legend has it that the
owl is the &ldquo;bird of wisdom.&rdquo; It was certainly
consecrated to the service of Pallas
Athene by the wise Greeks, whether
on account of a certain air of intelligence,
or because the goddess was herself
the moon and therefore a nocturnal
bird would be especially appropriate, we
may never know.</p>
<p>There is a story to the effect that on
one occasion, when an emblem of wisdom
was to be chosen, all the contestants for
the honor were finally eliminated except
the Philosopher and the Owl. When
the arguments in favor of the Philosopher
had been duly considered, the Owl
lifted up his voice and hooted: &ldquo;I do
not profess to embody all knowledge, but
I have that which is better. I possess
the art of concealing my ignorance.&rdquo;
Whereupon the judges, delighted with
the idea, unanimously elected him as the
better emblem of wisdom!</p>
<p>Many ancient customs had their origin
in Egypt. The Egyptian wise men told
the most learned of the Greeks that in
knowledge they were but children compared
with themselves. The superstitions
regarding the owl may have arisen
on the banks of the Nile, from a custom
of the king of the country, who, whenever
the death of a person was decided
upon, sent to such individual the image
of an owl, whereupon the unfortunate
one was expected to kill himself at once.
Small wonder the owl became in time
a bird of ill-omen.</p>

</div>
<p>The cherry-trees belong to the Rose
family (Rosaceae) and are thus botanically
related to the apple, rose, pear and
strawberry. The numerous cultivated
varieties are doubtless derived from the
cherry whose original home was Asia
Minor, from which country it spread to
Europe and other countries many centuries
ago. The plants are trees, mostly
not large but handsome because of the
green, simple, glossy serrated leaves and
the beautiful numerous white flowers and
the attractive red fruit. Pliny described
the plant and designated Asia as its original
home. About 63 B. C. the plant
was brought to Rome. From Italy the
cherry rapidly spread through Europe,
for it was cultivated along the Rhine
countries, in Belgium and in England,
even during the time of Pliny. Alexander
Trallianus recommended the fruit
very highly in the treatment of consumption
and in diseases of the liver.</p>
<p>In the language of flowers cherry blossoms
signify inconstancy, which is somewhat
peculiar, since the tree and the fruit
are so frequently mentioned in a favorable
sense in legend and folklore. Christ
at one time gave Peter a cherry with the
admonition not to despise little things.
The tree is also consecrated to the Virgin
Mary according to a tradition.</p>
<p>Cherry trees are cultivated throughout
all civilized countries. As with most
other long cultivated fruits the various
varieties are the product of crossing
(cross-pollination), artificial selection
and cultivation, and desirable plants are
perpetuated by grafting. There are various
wild growing species of cherry,
which must not be confused with the
cultivated varieties. The wild black
cherry (Prunus serotina) is very common
in our woods. It is a handsome
tree, varying from 15 to 100 feet in
height. It has a smooth bark on the
younger branches. The fruit is rather
small, fleshy portion thin and of a very
dark color when fully ripened. The wild
black cherry must not be confused
with the poisonous choke cherry (Prunus
virginiana), which is a smaller tree and
has red berries instead of black. Double
caution is necessary since the scientific
names are interchanged in various
works. There is another Eastern cherry
known as wild red, bird or pin cherry
(Prunus pennsylvanica), which also has
red fruit. There is also the common
sweet cherry (Prunus avium). The
common peach (Prunus persica) and the
common garden plum (Prunus domestica)
are close of kin.</p>
<p>The fruit of the cultivated domestic
cherry is the most desirable and is usually
had in mind when cherries are mentioned.
The fruit is technically a stone
fruit or drupe and not a berry; the outer
portion of the fruit covering known as
exocarp is fleshy and constitutes the edible
portion. The endocarp is hard and
forms the shell which encloses the seed.
The fresh, fully ripened fruits are relished
most by children, as well as by
adults. Birds also are very fond of ripe
cherries. Robins are on such a keen lookout
for the ripening berries that the busy
farmer is often a total loser. These birds
often guard the trees jealously against
all intruders, clamorously alighting on
the very heads and shoulders of the boys
who presume to climb the trees to pick
the fruit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Cherry wine is made from the fleshy
pulp, which has an excellent quality and
flavor. Cherry syrup is the product of
fermentation and filtration with the addition
of sugar and is used as a flavor for
cold drinks and added to medicines to
improve their efficiency and to disguise
the taste. By crushing and distilling the
seeds cherry water is obtained. The
flowers and fruit stems are employed in
kidney and catarrhal troubles. Cherries
may be preserved by drying or pickling.
The fruits are also macerated in whisky
and brandy, adding to these drinks an
agreeable flavor and acidity. For this
purpose the fruit of the wild black cherry
is very extensively used. The bark,
particularly of the wild black cherry, is
extensively employed in medicine. It is
a very popular household remedy for the
treatment of coughs and colds in children.
The gum which exudes from the
incised or otherwise injured bark is also
used medicinally.</p>
<p>Cherry wood is hard and takes a good
polish. It is used in cabinet making, interior
finish and for inlaid work.</p>
<p>Cherries are also employed by the confectioner
and by the baker in making
pies. The seeds (kernels, pits) are first
removed. The habit of swallowing the
pits is a dangerous one, as serious and
even fatal troubles are caused by them.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Petals of sunset and flame,</p>
<p class="t">Their orient, velvet-soft splendor</p>
<p class="t0">Aflare on long, sinuous stems,</p>
<p class="t">Aromatic, pale-tinted and slender.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Trespassers wilful and bold,</p>
<p class="t">Wherever they choose they wander,</p>
<p class="t0">Spendthrift of color and scent&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Made but to riot and squander.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">E&rsquo;en to the court of the rose,</p>
<p class="t">Their eager, loose tendrils outreaching;</p>
<p class="t0">Unable to guess at her pride,</p>
<p class="t">Or to care for her thorn&rsquo;s sharp teaching.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet such is their charm and delight,</p>
<p class="t">One pauses, half ready to flout them;</p>
<p class="t0">For O, at the mid-summer&rsquo;s height,</p>
<p class="t">What were the garden without them?</p>
